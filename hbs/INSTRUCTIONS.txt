This is the source code of my 1st dissertation project.

I simulate the consequnces of a pension reform for old-age income inequality
work has been published in LABOUR ECONOMICS (2018) as: "The effects of pension reforms on old-age inequality"

stata files do
	- manipulate and order spell-data of IAB (employment-histories)
	- transform tp panel data
	- create central variables
	- sample selection
	- save as csv

matlab-files do
	- estimate dyn discrete choice model of retirement entry
	- simulate consequences of a reform



some files are redundant and commentation is, in general, limited. I' try to fix that in the near future.
